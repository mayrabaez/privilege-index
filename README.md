# 🟣 Privilege Index — Colombia

An interactive tool to reflect on your starting point in life.

---

## 🧭 What is this?

The Privilege Index invites you to reflect on how certain factors, such as your birthplace, family income, education, race, gender identity, or access to networks, may have influenced your access to opportunities in Colombia.

By answering **14 yes/no questions**, you'll get a score between **-6** (facing more structural barriers) and **+9** (having more access and systemic advantage).

## 💡 What's it for?

This isn't about guilt or judgment. It's a mirror — designed to help you better understand your story and, hopefully, cultivate compassion for yourself and others.

Use it in:
- 🧠 Workshops or classrooms  
- 💬 Conversations about justice and equity  
- 🪞 Personal reflection
