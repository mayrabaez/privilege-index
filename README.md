# Privilege Index Colombia 🧭

A simple, reflective web app that helps users explore how structural privilege may shape their life experiences in Colombia.

By answering 14 yes/no questions — related to geography, race, gender identity, income, education, and more — users receive a score ranging from -6 (more structural barriers) to +9 (more systemic advantage).

This tool is not about guilt or blame. It's about awareness, perspective, and empathy.

## 🌟 Why this exists

I created this project to spark curiosity and reflection, especially among young Colombians (Millennials & Gen Z). Many of us want to build a more just world, but we don’t always have the tools or language to start that journey.

This app is meant to be:
- 🪞 A mirror: to see what advantages or obstacles we may have had.
- 🧠 A nudge: to question what we’ve normalized.
- 💬 A conversation starter: for classrooms, community groups, or friends.
